With this in mind I've taken a very simple and intuitive look at the shader definition, added a few additional parameters to the default shader (e.g., a line of code), made sure that the code was as clean as possible and so on.\n",

      "public static void main(String[] args) { // ... Game.setInitialState (true); }\n",

      "\n",
      "This also enables you to add a simple method in your custom shader and return the object. The \"state code\" is always a single line of code where we pass a state to the method. In the example above we could pass one line of code which would be the current state and another line which would be the state before the method would call. Now the \"time\" section of the example comes in, and we will just have to make the object the proper time to pass to our method.\n",

      "\n",
      "We created a custom module for Godot 4 and it was very useful: it provided a full-featured application, which I didn't need, but you had to use a node server, which allowed you to create your own node without any external dependencies (like web hosting). It was easy enough to do, but there were a lot of side-effects.\n",
      "\n",
      "However Godot 4.1 has a ton of new features, so we added another new feature – a default module to download modules in the app's database, which you can use to browse the content.\n",

      "And after making a change that added a default module to download modules, the database was loaded from the server and started downloading them at runtime. If your local database is not up to date, or you don't have it, or you find the module you want to download, or you find someone that you don't want to download, Godot would pick up the request, which is basically how you'd find your module.\n",

That makes it easier for us to understand which modules we are targeting.\n",

The first thing you see in Godot 4.3 is the nav bar, which will be shown next to your location on the screen. You'll also be able to see which of your icons were hit by this game.

If you have a specific icon hitting recently, and the icon is getting hit frequently, you'll need to use your scroll wheel to sort through all this info before you actually see your icon (which is probably hard to find, but I'm sure it is there) or if you have a specific icon getting hit a long time ago (like I do with the health bars above).\n",

This is where the game might see things that would otherwise remain on the bottom of the screen. They won't, and they won't appear on the next screen, which would mean that Godot 4.3 just doesn't actually read everything you're viewing (but rather just knows what icons are hit and whether or not they are), and it doesn't really do that much when you scroll down all this info up or down (like in the screenshot above).\n",
