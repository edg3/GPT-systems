To add any new elements to the scene, select [Create a new scene](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/_images/_creating_new_scene.png).\\nYou can then click on the new image to expand it to fit your game's editor.\\nBy default, the editor will open and show you a list of available elements. You can also save it as a file, which can be used to save your game to the cloud, or as a reference to a project.\\nIn Godot 4.3, you can open the editor with an arrow.\\nBy default, Godot will use the built-in \"Node.js\" compiler, which is also the name of the game engine.\\nIn the \"Scene Editor\", select [Start](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/_images/_scripting-node-nodes/start).\\nIn the editor window, type [Start](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/_images/_scripting_node-nodes/start.png) and press [Enter].\\nFinally, you can save your game or open it as a new object, using the [File > Save As](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/_images/examples/save-as.png).\\n\\nWhen finished, you can export Godot to your local drive using the 'Save & Play...' menu.\\n<br/>\\nYou can find the Godot editor in the 'Tools > Library</div>\\nThe Godot editor also allows you to open files in a new window with the [Create a new window](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/_images/create_new_window.png), which opens the editor within the file system.\\nGodot is available on Windows, Mac and Linux.
